# Power-BI-Project
This project explores sales and supply chain insights through a visually appealing online report. Using data from Kaggle, I transformed and cleaned the dataset with Power Query in Power BI, created custom calculations using DAX, and built a strong data model by establishing relationships between tables. The interactive dashboard provides insights into sales performance, supply chain efficiency, and operational trends.
